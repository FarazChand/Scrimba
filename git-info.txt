Creating a repo:
- First create the remote repo on github
- Go to the download code button ( green ) and copy the url they provide (url to remote repo)
- Then go into the directory that you want to be stored in this remote repo, this will be your local repo.
- write these commands in your vsCode terminal

git init 			- create empty repository in current working directory
git add . 			- staging all of the files inside of the local directory, getting them ready to commit
git commit -m "description"	- commits the files to the local repository, the description for the first commit is "First commit"
git remote add origin url...	- gets the connects the remote repository with the local repo ( url is the url that github gives you for your remote repo when you click download code)
git push -u origin master	- pushes the local repo into the remote repo 


Updating existing remote repo:
git add .			- same thing as above
git commit -m "description"	- same thing, description is just describing what changed
git push -u origin master	- same thing as above, final step ;D
