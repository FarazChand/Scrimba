First Run
---------
Took me about 3 - 4 hours to complete the html and the css for the mobile version.

- writing the structure of the html was not a problem, what I did have a problem with was filling it with content.
	-> though I did not have the content ready to copy and pase, I still think I could do this much faster
	-> I used the page up/down to move between the content and the html, copying and pasting each portion line by line
	-> this meant going up and down the page multiple times, each time I had a chance of forgeting where exactly I was which costed me a couple seconds
	-> a better way to do this is to copy and past each section that Im working on next to its html counter part
	-> once I'm finished inserting the content, I can then delete the commented content, and proceed to repeat the process with the next section of content

- I did things in a weird order
	-> I went back and forth between typography, layout and spacing
	-> this was not a good idea, caused confusion which wasted time
	-> I should have done all the typography first, then the big layout, then moved on to the smaller component layout
	-> after all was done, only then should I have worried about the spacing
	->  obviously I can go back and forth when required, however, I should try to keep this at a minimum

- not commiting to margin bottoms wasted some time
	-> I needed to just have margin bottoms, instead I experimented with having different combinations for a bit
	-> having just margin bottoms ended up being the best play, was easier to configure everything

- not knowing the exact details of the typography and spacing cost me a lot of time of experimenting with different sizes.
	-> i think the majority of time wasted was wasted here
	-> trying to make the font look good instead of just following the design was a big time sink
	-> also, certain parts of the design did not have the dimensions available
	-> i need to have all of the details ironed out before attempting the next run, at least for typography

- the thing with the zoom % was funny
	-> coulnd't get the breakpoint to trigger for certain parts like the nav because I was so zoomed out LOL
	-> also didn't realize that my website and the example on XD did not match up because of a different in zoom levels

- creating the desktop version was ok, but could be better
	- I had to figure out how to stop my aside images from shrinking with the screen, did this by giving their container a min-width
	- sloppy with selecting names, cost me a few min - just need to pay more attention in general
	
- figured out why my image sizes looked so different from the XD examples even though I calculated the widths in ems...
	-> forgot that em is not relevant to the font size of the root but to the element it is in (when not used for font size itself)
	-> I was calculating the px-em conversion using 16px(root default), when I should have been calculating it with 18px(1.125rem)
	-> this is because I changed my font size in the body, which changed the default font-size for every element
	-> this ended up making every image too big because I was dividing the px by a smaller number, resulting in more ems

Good things:

- building mobile first was awesome, and 100% the way to go
- once you get the mobile parts done, all you have to do for the desktop is figure out the layout
	-> this means setting flex direction to row for the main container, and for each recent article
	-> this also means setting the appropriate width for the items within those containers, as well as allowing spacing
	-> this also means understanding that a % width can cause some of your containers (the aside) to shrink too much which makes the image in them shrink too much
	-> the fix for this was give the aside container a min-width
